# NLP_SQuAD2.0_BERT

## What is SQUAD V2 ?
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 unanswerable questions written adversarially by crowdworkers to look similar to answerable ones. To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.

## What is BERT ?

BERT is a method of pre-training language representations, meaning that we train a general-purpose "language understanding" model on a large text corpus (like Wikipedia), and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks that we care about (like question answering). BERT outperforms previous methods because it is the first unsupervised, deeply bidirectional system for pre-training NLP.

Unsupervised means that BERT was trained using only a plain text corpus, which is important because an enormous amount of plain text data is publicly available on the web in many languages.

In order to learn relationships between sentences, we also train on a simple
task which can be generated from any monolingual corpus: Given two sentences `A`
and `B`, is `B` the actual next sentence that comes after `A`, or just a random
sentence from the corpus?

```
Sentence A: the man went to the store .
Sentence B: he bought a gallon of milk .
Label: IsNextSentence
```

```
Sentence A: the man went to the store .
Sentence B: penguins are flightless .
Label: NotNextSentence
```
We then train a large model (12-layer to 24-layer Transformer) on a large corpus (Wikipedia + BookCorpus) for a long time (1M update steps), and that's BERT.
